# KAMI

## Description
A small but capable micro web framework for the Go programming language.

## Objectives
The library is primarily aimed at microservices that back frontend applications consuming JSON via JavaScript's Fetch API.
The framework also supports serving static files from directories.
Web templates are also planned.

## Philosophy
The author aims to keep the library small enough that reading the code and a few examples can serve as the documentation.

## Getting Started

### Installing Task

This project uses [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) as a task runner. To install it:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d -b ~/.local/bin
```

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install go-task/tap/go-task
```

**Other installation methods:**
See the [official Task installation guide](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) for additional options including package managers for various platforms.

## Examples

The project includes example applications demonstrating various features:

### Quickstart Example
A basic example showing routing and JSON responses.

**Run with:**
```bash
task run:example:quickstart
```

**Features demonstrated:**
- Basic routing with `GET` requests
- URL parameters (`:id`)
- JSON responses using `responders.JSONResponse`
- Handler functions returning `types.Responder`

**Source:** [examples/quickstart/main.go](examples/quickstart/main.go)

### Static File Serving Example
Demonstrates serving static files from an embedded filesystem.

**Run with:**
```bash
task run:example:static
```

**Features demonstrated:**
- Serving static files with `ServeStatic`
- Using Go's `embed.FS` to bundle assets
- Filesystem mounting at specific routes

**Source:** [examples/static/main.go](examples/static/main.go)

## Usage

### Routing Paths

- Parameters are defined with a leading colon `:`
    - The router disallows path prefixes followed by a different parameter name. For example, registering both of these paths would lead to an error:
    ```
    /foo/bar/:buzz
    /foo/bar/:bazz
    ```

- Wildcards are defined with a leading asterisk `*`

- The match precedence for a path is:
  `static` → `:parameter` → `*wildcard`

### Context Parameters

- Any values read from the URL are stored in the request context
- A `map[string]string` of parameter value key-value pairs can be retrieved with `GetParams(req.Context())`
- If there are no params, expect an empty `map[string]string`
- Users should check that a value exists in the map using the standard Go idiom: `val, exists := params[key]`


### Middleware

The framework supports two types of middleware:

#### Global Middleware

Global middleware can be added to the router using the `Use` method, which accepts one or more middleware functions:

```go
r := router.New()
r.Use(router.Logger)
r.Use(myCustomMiddleware1, myCustomMiddleware2)
```

Global middleware is applied to **all routes** and can be added at any time during route registration. It is applied at **request time**, giving you flexibility in when you register it.

#### Route-Specific Middleware

Route-specific middleware can be provided as additional arguments when registering a route:

```go
r.GET("/admin", adminHandler, authMiddleware, rateLimitMiddleware)
r.POST("/api/data", dataHandler, validateMiddleware)
```

Route-specific middleware is applied **only to that specific route** and is composed at **registration time** for better performance.

#### Execution Order

When both global and route-specific middleware are used, they execute in this order:

```go
r.Use(logger, cors)                    // Global middleware
r.GET("/admin", handler, auth, rateLimit)  // Route-specific middleware

// Execution order: logger -> cors -> auth -> rateLimit -> handler
```

The middleware signature is:

```go
func(next types.Handler) types.Handler
```

#### Built-in Middleware

- `router.Logger` - Logs each request with method, path, status code, and duration

### Path Registration

The addition of a path mutates the radix tree used for lookups and is NOT thread-safe.
The expectation is that routes will be registered prior to the server performing any path lookups.
Lookups are read-only and therefore thread-safe.
